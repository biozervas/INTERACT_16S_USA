# Experimental setup

A plant growth experiment was conducted under climate chamber conditions to profile the root-associated bacterial and archaeal community structure of four wheat varieties.
Field soil was collected from the plough layer (0–25 cm) at the North Carolina State University’s Lower Coastal Plain Research Station in Kingston, North Carolina, United States of America. (35.378305, -77.559656). After collecting, the soil was quarantined at North Carolina State University’s Phytotron for approximately two months. Soil was classified as a sandy loam soil, and the field had been fertilized with N:P:K at a rate of 174:0:101 kg  ha−1y−1 since 2017. D60H Deepots measuring 35.56 cm in height and 7 cm in diameter were prepared for planting by field soil and a 100 mL of a nutrient solution (NCSU Phytotron Nutrient Solution https://phytotron.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Nutrient-info.pdf). Seeds of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars Hilliard, Shirley, Catawba and USG-3640 were supplied by Cunningham Research Station in Kinston, NC, USA (Hilliard, Shirley and Catawba) and Mohamed Meroum at the University of Georgia, GA, USA (USG-3640) and sown in soil-filled pots with 100 individuals per variety (1 plant per pot). In addition, three empty pots with soil served as a control. Plants were germinated for 10 days under controlled climate chamber conditions with photoperiods of 8 H/22 °C days, 16 H/15 °C nights with 30% humidity and 539 mmol light. Plants were subsequently vernalized for 56 days with growth chamber settings of 8 h/6 °C days and 16 h/4 °C nights with 30% humidity and 520 mmol light. Following 56 days of vernalization, the wheat growth experiment was carried out under controlled greenhouse conditions with photoperiods of 8 H/22 °C days, 16 H/15 °C nights with 30% humidity and 539 mmol light. The varieties were sampled after the flag leaf fully emerged at day 98 (Catawba), day 100 (Hilliard and USG-3640) and day 105 (Shirley).

# Sampling of bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane and endosphere bacterial and archaeal communities

Sampled plants were chosen based on plant height, which was measured from the base of the plant to bottom of the last emerging leaf. Using this measurement of plant height, the five tallest plants and the five shortest plants were selected. In addition, three soil control samples were taken. Soil control samples represented field soil that was potted alongside plants and underwent the same climate chamber conditions and plant watering and nutrient treatments but did not contain any wheat plants. Each plant was removed in its entirety from the pot. The plant was shaken into a paper bag to collect a sample of the bulk soil. The bulk soil was transferred to a 15 mL falcon tube from which 1 gram was measured out and placed in a 50 mL falcon tube containing 25 mL of sterile water. After the bulk soil sample was collected, the plant was shaken to remove all excess soil, leaving a thin layer of soil which remained attached to the roots. To extract root-associated microbiomes, the root including attached soil was separated into two equally sized sub-samples at the longitudinal axis to represent the full length of the root. This half of the root sample was used to extract rhizosphere, rhizoplane and endosphere communities. For rhizosphere communities, the root sample was transferred to a 50 mL falcon tube containing 25 mL sterile water, and subsequently shaken. Roots were removed and the soil remaining in the tube was defined as rhizosphere. Removed roots were washed with sterile water to remove any remaining soil and transferred to a new 50 mL falcon tube with 25 mL sterile water, which was then shaken and sonicated for 10 minutes at the lowest setting using a sonication bath. Following sonication, the roots were removed. This sample was defined as rhizoplane. Roots were then sterilized using an ethanol-bleach-ethanol bath. Roots were placed in a 70% ethanol bath for 2 minutes, then a 0.5% bleach solution for 2 minutes followed by another 70% ethanol bath for 2 minutes. Any remaining ethanol and bleach were removed by placing roots in a sterile water bath for 2 minutes, repeating three times. After the last sterile water bath, the water was decanted, and roots were flash frozen. Once completely frozen, roots were than macerated using a mortar and pestle and the macerated roots were collected in a 50 mL falcon tube with 25 mL of sterile water. For soil control, 1 g of soil was added to 25 mL of sterile water. All samples (bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, endosphere and soil control) were flash frozen and subsequently freeze-dried. Approximately 200 mg of freeze-dried sample was weighed out and placed into sterile beaded tubes for DNA/RNA co-extraction.

# Bioinformatics analysis

The raw sequencing data was analyzed using DADA2 (version 1.8.0) implemented in the DeCIFR toolkit (https://tools.decifr.hpc.ncsu.edu/dada2) with default settings and the SILVA database (version 138) for taxonomic assignment. Microbiome statistical analysis and visualization were performed using Phyloseq (version 1.38.0), also implemented in the DeCIFR toolkit (https://tools.decifr.hpc.ncsu.edu/phyloseq).
